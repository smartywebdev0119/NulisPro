		  <h1>Hot Prompts</h1>
		  This tool allows you to discover prompts that are about to take off,
		  but do not have many replies yet.
		  Replying to these prompts maximizes the chances that your story will
		  get more attention - it has a good chance of being visible on the front page, without getting buried under hundreds of other replies.
		  <br/>
		  <br/>
		  <i class="fa fa-hashtag"></i> - Position of the prompt on the front page of /r/WritingPrompts
