Describe the general idea of your story in the first column, then create child cards to the right of it to add more details. \n\nCards in the second column can describe your story outline, and cards in the third column can describe your scenes.\n\nYou can create more cards or rearrange them to conveniently edit your story.",

Try it now!\n\nTo switch between editing/preview modes use `Ctrl+Enter`. Double click and `Enter` also work for entering the edit mode.\n\n`Alt+F` toggles the fullscreen mode in the editor.\n\nAlso, you can delete cards with `Ctrl+Backspace`, and undo things with `Ctrl-Z`.",
