It makes the process of outlining your stories, articles, or books easy, fun, and convenient.\n\nFeel free to edit this page to experiment with it, don't worry, it's a template, you can always reopen it from the `About` menu.\n\nPress `Ctrl+Enter` to try editing cards, click `+` buttons to create new ones, drag cards by the handle(to the left of the card) to rearrange them.\n\nRead on to the second column to learn more.\n\n#three #two",

The purpose of Nulis is to help you to write in the state of flow.\n\nNulis allows you to edit your story on multiple different levels. Describe the general idea of your story or an article in the first column, then create child cards to the right of it to add more details. \n\nFor example cards in the second column can describe your story outline, and cards in the third column can describe your scenes.\n\n#one #two",

So for example to create a card to the right, you would press `Ctrl+Shift+L`, and to move the card down you'd press `Alt+J`. Try it now!\n\nTo switch between editing/preview modes use `Ctrl+Enter`. Double click and `Enter` also work for entering the edit mode.\n\n`Alt+F` toggles the fullscreen mode in the editor.\n\nAlso, you can delete cards with `Ctrl+Backspace`, and undo things with `Ctrl-Z`.",
